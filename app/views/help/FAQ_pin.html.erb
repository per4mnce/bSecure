"## What is a 'PIN' and why is it important?

bSecure uses your PIN to create a key used to encrypt and decrypt your information.
You must enter your PIN each time you access bSecure because your PIN is **never** stored by our application.
This means there is no way for us or anyone else to recover your information if you loose your key.

### PIN Guidelines:
* Treat it like a critical password
* Make it complex and difficult to guess
* Use a combination of numbers and uppercase/lowercase letters
* Don't use the same password as your bSecure login password" %>
