"## What is the signifigance of you PIN?

bSecure uses your pin to create a key used to encrypt and decrypt your information.
You must enter your PIN each time you access bSecure because your PIN is **never** stored by our application.
This means there is no way for us or anyone else to recover your information if you loose your key.

### PIN Guidelines:
* Treat it like a password
* Make it complex and difficult to guess
* Use a combination of numbers and uppercase/lowercase letters" %>
